Cell Phone Price Prediction Project

Business Case:
Bob's mobile company aims to compete in the smartphone market but lacks pricing expertise. To address this, sales data is collected to predict mobile prices. The project focuses on developing a machine learning model for multiclassification to categorize phones into price ranges.

Key Findings:

Explored balanced price distribution, 50-50 Bluetooth prevalence, and trends in battery power, RAM, and weight.
Identified RAM, battery power, and pixel quality as significant influencers on prices.
Support Vector Machine with hyperparameter tuning emerged as the optimal model.
Skin Disorder Prediction Project

Business Case:
Developing a machine learning model to predict skin diseases and providing early identification recommendations to doctors.

Key Findings:

Comprehensive data analysis performed for skin disorder classification.
Implemented Random Forest Classifier with 97% accuracy and a high F1 score on the test set.
Proved robustness and versatility in handling complex relationships and mitigating overfitting.
Insurance Cost Prediction Project

Business Case:
The insurance industry seeks accurate premium prediction. The project aims to develop a regression model considering factors like age, coverage type, BMI, and health habits.

Key Objectives:

Create a predictive model to estimate insurance premiums.
Improve risk assessment and pricing strategies for insurance companies.
Liver Patient Prediction Project

Business Case:
Utilizing the Indian Liver Patient Dataset for liver health analysis. The project includes disease prediction, risk factor analysis, and practical applications.

Key Conclusions:

Final recommendation: XGBoost classifier with hyperparameter tuning.
Achieved 100% training accuracy and 85% accuracy on the test set.
Strong generalization capabilities and reliability across diverse scenarios.
